        <p class="tq">Happiest birthday my cute little babygirlðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜. Lately, i've been so grateful that you are mine and only mine. I've never thought that i'd have a girl by my side but guess what??? I've got the most perfect girl i could've asked for, i dont know what i did to deserve you but indeed the prayers worked. Have you ever felt the presence of home in someone??? I did baby, every time i look into your eyes, thats when i know you're the one, you are literally everything i've ever wanted. I dont just see a gf in you, i see my whole life in you baby, you're literally my whole world. Those little glances across the classroom, those little touches, those little blushes are what made my day and it still makes my day. whenever i'm around you, you know how safe i feel??? When you wrap me around your arms, thats when i feel the safest, even 6 hours felt like 6 minutes when im with you. Let's make a promise that we're never ever giving up on each other and we're gonna get through all the hard times and we'd hold each other's hands till our deathbed. I wanna grow old with you, i wanna have a family with you and moreover i wanna be with you! Forever and ever! you know what makes me the most happiest person in the world??? Its just the fact that your mine makes me the happiest person in the world. Putting a smile on your faceðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, i just love it so so much and i wanna do it for the rest of my life, i wanna take good care of you, our family and everyone around us. Imma treat you like my princess and im never ever letting anyone or anything hurt my babygirl. All i ever want in my life is you. its you. its only you.You are my home in a person and infact you are  my everything baby. A life with you is all i want. I love you so much babygirlðŸ˜˜.</p>    </section>
